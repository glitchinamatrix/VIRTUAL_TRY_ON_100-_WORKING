# Virtual Try-On with Pose Detection

This project is a virtual try-on application that uses pose detection to overlay clothing images on a person's body in real-time. The application captures video, detects body poses using OpenCV and cvzone, and overlays a shirt image based on the detected pose.

## Features

- Real-time video capture and processing.
- Pose detection using the cvzone library.
- Overlay of shirt images on detected body pose.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/virtual-tryon.git
    cd virtual-tryon
    ```

2. Create a virtual environment:

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. Install the required packages:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

1. Ensure you have your video file in the `Resource/video` directory and shirt images in the `Resource/shirts` directory.
2. Run the application:

    ```bash
    python shirt_tryon.py
    ```

## Files
